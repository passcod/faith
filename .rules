- Overview:
  - a NAPI-rs project
  - aims to build a fetch spec-compliant implementation backed by a Rust networking stack
  - index.js and index.d.ts are generated by napi
- Tests:
  - use with `HTTPBIN_URL=http://localhost:8888`, to avoid public HTTP calls and make tests deterministic
  - run a single test: `HTTPBIN_URL=http://localhost:8888 npx tape test/blob.test.js`
  - run just the rust tests: `cargo test`
  - run all tests: `HTTPBIN_URL=http://localhost:8888 npm it`
  - when using `npx tape` directly, remember to run `npm run build` (or `npm i`) first so the native binding is rebuilt if there were Rust changes—`npx tape` by itself doesn’t rebuild. The repo’s `test` script runs `cargo test` first.
  - if localhost:8888 isn't available, prompt the user to start it with: `docker run --rm -d -p 8888:80 kennethreitz/httpbin`
- Attitude:
  - Don't edit the README.md
  - Don't leave comments in the code referencing actions taken
  - Don't leave "useless" comments that add no value to the code
  - If an action seems too complex, prompt the user about it before discarding the idea, explaining clearly the tradeoffs involved
